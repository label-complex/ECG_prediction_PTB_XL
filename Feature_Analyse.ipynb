The raw waveform data was annotated by up to two cardiologists, who assigned potentially multiple ECG statements to each record. The in total 71 different [ECG statements](https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.3/scp_statements.csv) conform to the SCP-ECG standard and cover diagnostic, form, and rhythm statements.
